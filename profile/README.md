This is the home of the SuCCESs integrated assessment model (IAM) and it's land-use module CLASH.

SuCCESs IAM is currently under development (the development repository is private), but will be made public soon (later during 2024).

CLASH is fully available and described in detail in the paper "CLASH - Climate-responsive Land Allocation model with carbon Storage and Harvests", published in Geoscientific Model Development: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/17/3041/2024/
